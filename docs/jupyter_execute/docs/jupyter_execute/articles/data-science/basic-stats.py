## Terms and Stat Introduction


# Data is usually recorded in data matrix where: - 
# 
# - `Case` or `Observational Unit` - A single record or usually a row of data.
# - `Characteristics` - Characteristics are the individual column.
# 
# 
# **Types of variables**
# 
# - Numerical
#     - Continuous - Continuous numerical values.
#     - Discrete - Numerical values with jumps.
# - Categorical
#     - Ordinal - Represents a category but the levels have a natural ordering.
#     - Nominal - categorical variable without this type of special ordering is called a nominal variable.
# 
# 
# **Variable relationships**
# 
# - Independent Variables : The do not seem to have any relationship with each other.
# - Associated Variables : They seem to have some relationship (positively corelated or negetively corelated) with each other.
# 
# **Observational studies vs Experiments**
# 
# - Observational - When data is collected in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise.
# - Experimental - When researchers want to investigate the possibility of a causal connection, they conduct an experiment. Usually there will be both an explanatory and a response variable.
# 
# **Sample and Population**
# A sample represents a subset of the cases and is often a small fraction of the population. Usually it is too expensive to collect data from the entire population.
# 
# **Sampling Methods**
